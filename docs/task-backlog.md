# Insight & Merchandising Follow-ups

- Replace the simple text-based proposal PDF stub with a proper templated PDF generator (e.g., pdfkit) and persist/download the asset alongside proposal summary metadata.
- Add true geo distance calculations for Local Demand Map & Radius Insights using tenant/home-store coordinates plus lead/event latitude/longitude (or geocoded postal codes) to populate radius buckets accurately.
- Extend Deep Attribution Explorer to surface full multi-touch timelines (all marketing events with timestamps and weights) instead of only first/last touch, and expose filters for channel, campaign, and date range.
